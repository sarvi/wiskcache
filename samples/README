To generate a suite of bench-mark makefiles,
you can use genbench.py

genbench.py --help


With some modifications, we could generate a suite
that supports ccache and wiskcache.
For now, look at these makefiles as samples of the changes
required. 
Soon, we will update genbench.py to add these changes
automatically.
